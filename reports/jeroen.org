* data

** yaleb

two versions of the extended yaleb dataset exist; original and cropped. in the
cropped version, images are aligned and cropped. we use the cropped version, as
it is easier to work with.

additionally, the lighting positions corresponding to the images used for the
training partition of the data are specified as "top left, top, top right,
bottom left, bottom right", but only coordinates are specified in the
dataset. hence, we estimated these positions to correspond to the coordinates

#+BEGIN_SRC python
train_positions = {
    (-110, 65),
    (0, 90),
    (110, 65),
    (110, -20),
    (-110, -20),
}
#+END_SRC

based on this plot of these coordinates present in the dataset:

** cifar100

the authors, following [20], repurpose the cifar100 dataset to become a
privacy-sensitive dataset. cifar100 has 100 fine classes, which are categorized
in 20 coarse super-classes. the fine classes are sensitive attribute, coarse
classes target attribute.

however, it is not said whether or not the fine classes are included as input
to the model. even though it would make sense because sensitive attributes are
also included in other datasets, it would be non-trivial to shape the input in
a 2d rectangle, and thus would not make a lot of sense when using a CNN.
