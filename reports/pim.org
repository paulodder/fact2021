* Inconsistencies

- no lambda parameters for YaleB
- they just mention using a vae as baseline but give no other real information
  that would allow us to properly understand their training procedure and
  reproduce their results

- the baselines they give that use the raw data for the target and sensitvei
  predicitons:
  we can replicate the adilt
  we cant replicate the german, we get lower than them but makes sense seeing
  as out majoirty vote is lower hinting that the task is slightly harder for
  the split we have

- it is unclear what reconstruction loss they use for the VAE they trained on
  the tabular datasets

- we can reproduce the logistic regression model on the yaleb
