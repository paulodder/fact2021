* introduction
who are we?
* what is the goal?
- make predictions based on data invariant to certain sensitive information
  (like gender when predicting salary)
- but leaving it out is no guarantee that the data still contains proxies for
  sensitive data (occupation)
- approach by this paper is to construct representations of our data such that
  these representations are independent of the sensitive information
* how do we attain this goal?
* what are we going to reproduce?
- 5 datasets
- look at 2: =adult= =cifar100=
* adult
- introduce adult, what does the data look like
* adult results
- show and discuss their results vs. ours:
  - target and sensitive accuracy compared with VAE and X?
* cifar10
- ablative
left out parts of the loss terms
very unstable
* discussion
some were reproducible, most weren't
lack of crucial information e.g. # epochs, stopping condition?
