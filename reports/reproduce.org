*  Introduction
This file serves the purpose of documenting the scripts that generate any of
the results in our paper, aswell as describing/explaining our ability to
reproduce the reference papers results in terms of senstivity/target accuracy.

* Reproduction accuracies
In general:
things clarified through communtication with authors which were not clear in
paper:
- step size
- how to update lambdas
- vae embeddings training procedure

things still unclear
dataste size yaleb

** adult
-adult is reproducible with standard hyperparameters,
- we can reproduce the logistic regression on VAE embeddings,


** german
german is not reproducible with standard hyperparameters, unless we turn off the
weight freezing (i.e. we also update the backbone network with the sensitive
The VAE baseline is not really reproducible, but it should be noted that how to
train the VAE is not entirely clear so there is room for discrepancy there.

PARAMETER SEARCH necessary, we should check whether ablative without freezing
preforms well (but we have senstivity anaysis)

** yaleb

we are unable to reproduce results for yaleb, but size of dataset different, it
was unclear how to assign the targets labels so there's room for
inconsistencies. ALso, a baseline logistic regression model doesn not obtain
the same results as with them, we get lower for sensitive

PARAMETER SEARCH NECESSARY

** cifar 10
reproducible with standard hyperparameters.

** cifar 100
seems to be unable to find a real minimum for the target prediction.

* Ablative study
The ablative study compares the effect of the composition of the loss term on
the sensitive and target accuracy. To generate the results for any given
dataset, we train the model with the best parameters according to Sarhan et
al. with the following possible combinations of loss components:
- Entropy with KL
- KL Orth w/o Entropy
- w/o Entropy w/o KL
- Entropy + KL w/o Orth
- Entropy + KL Orth.
In addition, we train a baseline classifier on the raw data, but at this point
we do not know what the baseline classifiers are.

To generate the results for each of the loss component combinations, and for
three random seeds we run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
bash scripts/ablative.sh <dataset name>
#+END_SRC
Where <dataset name> is one of =adult= =german= =cifar10= =cifar100= or
=yaleb=.
To visualize the results for a dataset we run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python scripts/visualize_ablative.py --dataset <dataset name>
#+END_SRC

Hence, to generate the images we run:
** adult
#+BEGIN_SRC python
bash scripts/ablative.sh adult
python scripts/visualize_ablative.py --dataset adult
#+END_SRC
[[file:../figures/ablative.adult.png]]
** german
#+BEGIN_SRC python
bash scripts/ablative.sh german
python scripts/visualize_ablative.py --dataset german
#+END_SRC
[[file:../figures/ablative.german.png]]
** yaleb
#+BEGIN_SRC python
bash scripts/ablative.sh yaleb
python scripts/visualize_ablative.py --dataset yaleb
#+END_SRC
[[file:../figures/ablative.yaleb.png]]
** cifar10
#+BEGIN_SRC python
bash scripts/ablative.sh cifar10
python scripts/visualize_ablative.py --dataset cifar10
#+END_SRC
[[file:../figures/ablative.cifar10.png]]
** cifar100
#+BEGIN_SRC python
bash scripts/ablative.sh cifar100
python scripts/visualize_ablative.py --dataset cifar100
#+END_SRC
[[file:../figures/ablative.cifar100.png]]
